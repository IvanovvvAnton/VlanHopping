# VlanHopping

## üí° Introduction
### üìö Relevance of the study

In the context of the active introduction of virtualization technologies and increasing information security requirements, logical network segmentation methods are becoming particularly important. One of these technologies is VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), a mechanism that allows you to logically divide devices connected to the same physical network into different virtual segments. This provides flexibility in network design, improves manageability, and enhances information security by isolating traffic.

However, despite its advantages, VLAN technology is subject to certain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information. One of these attacks is the VLAN hopping cyberattack, which allows an intruder to bypass segmentation restrictions and gain access to traffic transmitted on other VLANs. This threat is especially dangerous for corporate and government networks, where information security is of critical importance.

With the increasing use of VLANs in organizations of various fields, there is also an increasing interest in studying the vulnerabilities associated with this technology. Investigating the mechanisms of a VLAN hopping attack and ways to prevent it is becoming an important step in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of network communications.

Next, we will configure the network equipment

To set up a router on it, you need to create two VLANs, and configure automatic distribution of IP addresses for devices that will be located in these VLANs

# üîß Router Setup 
## üîÑ VLAN Creation
```
interface vlan add name=vlan50 vlan-id=50 interface=ether2
interface vlan add name=vlan55 vlan-id=55 interface=ether2
```
## üî¢ Assigning IP addresses for VLAN data
```
ip address add address=192.168.50.1/24 network=192.168.50.0 interface=vlan50
ip address add address=192.168.55.1/24 network=192.168.55.0 interface=vlan55
```
## üì° Configuring a DHCP server for a VLAN
```
dhcp server interface vlan 50 address space 192.168.50.0/24 gateway 192.168.50.1 addresses 192.168.50.2-192.168.50.100
dhcp server interface vlan 55 address space 192.168.55.0/24 gateway 192.168.55.1 addresses 192.168.55.2-192.168.55.100
```
## üîê Configuring NAT to access the external network
```

```
As a result, we will get the configuration, in order to output it, you can use the command
```
/ export compact
```

```
```
interface e0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 50
```
```
interface e0/3

### üîç Checking the status of the switch port status

To successfully implement a VLAN hopping cyberattack, it is important to determine the current status of the switch port to which the potential intruder's device is connected. In particular, it is necessary to check whether this port is in a mode that allows the automatic installation of a trunk connection, which can be used for embedding into other VLANs.

In Cisco technology, switches use the DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) protocol to automatically negotiate the port mode. The port can be in one of the following modes:

- The access port belongs to only one VLAN and does not allow traffic from other VLANs to pass through;

- The trunk port transmits traffic from several VLANs at once, identifying them using tags;

- Dynamic desirable ‚Äî the port is actively trying to establish a trunk connection if another port that supports DTP is connected to it;

- Dynamic auto ‚Äî the port passively waits for an offer to install a trunk from the opposite device.

To determine the current mode, use the command (on Cisco IOS hardware):

```
show interfaces e0/3 switchport
```

Output example:

To debug and view incoming RTP packets on a Cisco switch, you can use the debug rtp packet command. This command allows you to display detailed information about the process of exchanging DTP messages between the switch and the devices connected to the ports. By enabling debugging, the administrator can track which DTP packets are received on the ports and at what point their mode changes, which is useful for detecting VLAN hopping attack attempts.

## üí• Attack

To implement a VLAN hopping attack using the Yersinia utility in graphical mode, several steps must be followed. Yersinia is a powerful utility for testing and exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols, which provides a user‚Äîfriendly interface for dealing with various types of attacks, including vulnerabilities in the DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) protocol.

### ‚ö°Step 1: Install Yersinia

To install Yersinia on a Linux system, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yersinia
```

### üîì Step 2: Launch Yersinia in Graphical mode

After installing Yersinia, you can run it in the graphical interface, which greatly facilitates the process of configuring and monitoring the attack. To do this, run the following command:

```
sudo -E yersinia -G
```

The team runs Yersinia with a graphical interface, allowing you to use a user-friendly GUI to set up attacks. The -E option launches the utility with superuser rights, and -G indicates launch in graphical mode.

After executing this command, the Yersinia graphical window opens, in which you can configure the attack, select the target network protocol and start exploiting vulnerabilities.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Choosing an attack on the DTP protocol

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9fac62-90b8-45dd-ad9f-980ad2981af5)

### üèÅ Step 4: We launch the attack and see that it was successful

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a2594d-d6d7-42d7-9c5d-8d6ec90547d8)

When the VLAN hopping attack is successfully implemented using the Yersinia utility, the Cisco switch can detect a port configuration change and issue appropriate alerts about events. This is because the attack involves changing the status of the port, which can lead to the opening of a communication channel between different VLANs. Cisco switches use various mechanisms to monitor and respond to network anomalies, such as port configuration changes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e007b030-4b50-4f0e-be7f-d27640a36550)

After the VLAN hopping attack is successfully implemented and the port configuration is changed, the device that was originally in VLAN 55 is no longer displayed in the corresponding table. This may mean that the attacker was able to redirect traffic or connect to another VLAN, thus "removing" the device from VLAN 55. As a result, the VLAN table shows that there are no devices in this segment, although it was previously registered, which confirms successful intervention and manipulation of network settings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7902f7f-8f8e-4920-88e2-8016e8029470)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b28eeeb6-7941-448a-b5e0-c348bde495d7)

To further implement the attack, the intruder adds a new VLAN interface on his device using the command
```
vconfig add eth1 50
```
to create a virtual interface with the VLAN ID 50. Then, using the command
```
ifconfig eth1.50 192.168.50.50 up
```
it assigns to this interface an IP address corresponding to VLAN 50. Thus, the intruder's device now has access to the VLAN segment 50, which allows it to exchange data with other devices on this VLAN and continue the attack, for example, using the "man in the middle" method.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf821dc-1735-43a0-96f9-4a72252c39f8)

Check:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c194ad-8c8d-4793-893a-97aa1f97392a)

After adding the VLAN 50 interface and assigning the appropriate IP address, the intruder's device successfully jumps to another VLAN, in this case VLAN 50. This allows him to bypass network segmentation restrictions and gain access to resources located on this VLAN, including devices such as Ubuntu_work. Thus, the intruder can continue his actions, including intercepting traffic and interfering with network interactions between segments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection methods

1 To protect against VLAN hopping attacks related to DTP protocol vulnerabilities, an important step is to disable this protocol on switch ports that should not be involved in automatic trunk configuration. To do this, use the switchport nonegotiate command.

The switchport nonegotiate command disables the ability to automatically negotiate tanks with another device, which prevents the use of the DTP protocol to dynamically configure a trunk connection. As a result, the port will not attempt to establish a trunk connection with another device, even if it supports DTP. This significantly reduces the likelihood that an attacker will be able to exploit the DTP vulnerability to bypass segmentation and switch to other VLANs.

To apply this command, follow these steps on the switch:
```
configure terminal
interface e0/0
switchport nonegotiate
```

2 VLAN 1 is a standard VLAN that is used by default on most network devices, such as Cisco switches, for various network functions, including management and data exchange protocols. This VLAN often remains active on all switch ports, which makes it vulnerable to attacks, as attackers may try to use it to bypass network segmentation.

3 All unused ports should be moved to a separate dedicated VLAN. Unused ports on the switch left in standard VLANs can be used by intruders to gain unauthorized access to the network. To minimize this risk, inactive ports should be moved to an isolated, dedicated VLAN, such as VLAN 999 or another specifically designated for unused ports.

4 To increase network security, it is recommended to disable all unused ports on the switch to prevent intruders from using them to connect unauthorized devices. Disabling inactive ports helps reduce potential attack vectors, such as attacks using unregistered devices.

## üìù Conclusion

During the research and implementation of the VLAN hopping cyberattack, it was demonstrated how vulnerabilities in VLAN technology, in particular the DTP protocol, can be used to bypass network segmentation and gain access to data from other VLANs. We have shown how an attacker, using a vulnerability in the DTP protocol, can gain the ability to transfer traffic between network segments, leading to risks of data interception and possible man-in-the-middle attacks.

To prevent such attacks, several effective protection methods were considered, including disabling the DTP protocol, not using VLAN 1, and transferring all unused ports to isolated VLANs with their subsequent disconnection. All these measures are aimed at improving network security, reducing possible vulnerability points and improving access control to various network segments.

Thus, to effectively protect against VLAN hopping cyber attacks and other threats related to incorrect VLAN configuration, it is necessary to apply an integrated approach, including regular checking and updating of network equipment configuration, the use of modern monitoring tools and protection against unauthorized access. The implementation of the proposed protection methods significantly increases the level of security and resilience of the network infrastructure to potential threats.
